      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there, I am pursuing a career as a full stack developer, but my
        interest in AI/ML has led me to gain experience in that field as well. I
        enjoy working across both areas and look forward to opportunities that
        allow me to apply my diverse skillset. As a FOSS enthusiast, I am
        passionate about contributing to open source projects and advocating for
        open access to technology and knowledge.
